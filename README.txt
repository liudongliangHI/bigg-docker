*if you have an old version of Mac OS or MS Windows, you might have had to install
Docker Toolbox instead of Docker for [Mac|Windows]. In that case, docker should tell
you, upon booting, what is the IP of the VM hosting your containers. Go to that IP
instead, which should look like 192.168.*.* (e.g.: 192.168.99.100)
